This practical course explains step-by-step how to build a compiler. A basic programming language, called URIUM, has been defined, and the different stages of the compiler have been programmed in the course sessions. The developed compiler generates code for various processors (MIPS, Intel, and RISC-V) and operating systems (MS-Windows and Linux).
