    <p style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10; text-align: justify;">This 
	practical course on Compiler Design uses a simple programming language 
	called URIUM as a case study to develop the different stages of the 
	compilation process. The course consists of 12 sessions that can be adapted 
	to cover a semester. These sessions begin with the definition of the 
	language and progress to building a compiler that works on different 
	platforms.</p>
	<p style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10; text-align: justify;">The first 
	sessions are dedicated to the compiler analysis phase. This includes 
	manually programming the language's lexical analyzer (Lecture01), manually 
	programming the language's syntactic analyzer (Lecture02), manually 
	programming the language's semantic analyzer (Lecture03, Lecture04, and 
	Lecture05), and a version of the analyzers automatically generated by a 
	parser generator tool (Lecture06).</p>
	<p style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10; text-align: justify;">Special 
	attention has been given to the compiler's backend, generating object code 
	for different processors (MIPS, Intel, RISC-V) and operating systems 
	(MS-Windows, Linux). The second part of the course begins with intermediate 
	code generation (Lecture 07). Subsequent sessions focus on object code 
	generation for the various platforms. Lecture08 describes code generation 
	for the simulated MIPS32 processor using Qt-Spim. Lecture09 describes code 
	generation for the MS-Windows operating system on the Intel64 architecture. 
	Lecture10 focuses on code generation for the Linux operating system on the 
	AMD64 architecture. Lecture11 describes code generation for the simulated 
	RISC-V processor using RARS. Lecture12 focuses on code generation for the 
	Linux operating system on the RISC-V architecture.</p>

    URIUM is a process-oriented, imperative programming language (similar to C). 
	The goal of URIUM is to define a very simple programming language to support 
	the teaching of a basic course on Compiler Design. In each aspect of URIUM's 
	design (lexical, syntactic, and semantic specifications, data types, 
	instructions, etc.), the language has been simplified to allow for compiler 
	development both manually and with the aid of tools. In this way, the URIUM 
	language will serve as an example in the practical sessions that explain how 
	to develop the different stages of a compiler.</p>
	<p style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10; text-align: justify;">
    URIUM is the name the Romans gave to the Tinto River, located in the 
	province of Huelva, Spain. This river is known for the reddish color of its 
	waters, which is due to heavy metal sediments. The river originates in a 
	region that has been mined since ancient times by the Iberians, Phoenicians, 
	Romans, and Muslims. Copper and pyrite (iron sulfide) have been the main 
	minerals extracted from its mines. Numerous archaeological remains have been 
	found along the river, demonstrating the importance of this area since 
	antiquity. In 1930, a well-preserved Corinthian helmet from the 6th century 
	BC was discovered at its mouth. This helmet is one of the most important 
	archaeological pieces from that period found in Spain and is on display at 
	the National Archaeological Museum in Madrid.</p>

	  C (32 reserved words), C++ (95 reserved words), or Java (68 reserved

	32-bit registers. The <em>char</em> type is considered to be described in 
	8-bit ASCII code stored in the least significant byte (the 24 most

    <blockquote>
    <p style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10; text-align: justify;">
    Files described in the URIUM language use the &quot;<em>.ur</em>&quot; extension and 
	define procedure libraries. Each file contains a list of imported libraries 
	(<em>import</em> clauses) and a <em>library</em> whose name must match the 
	filename. A library name can consist of identifiers separated by periods. In 
	that case, the identifiers indicate the path where the source file should be 
	stored. For example, a library called <strong>mypkg.mysubpkg.MyLib</strong> 
	should be located at &quot;<em>/mypkg/mysubpkg/MyLib.ur</em>&quot;.</p>
		<p style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10; text-align: justify;">
    	The <em>library</em> consists of a list of procedures, which can be <em>
		public</em> or <em>private</em>. The code of the procedures can contain 
		calls to other public or private procedures within the same library. 
		They can also contain calls to public procedures from other libraries. 
		In the latter case, the called procedure is identified by the library 
		name, followed by a period and the procedure name. To use the procedures 
		of a library, it must have been previously imported into the file (an 
		alias can be assigned to the library at this point). </p>
		<p style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10; text-align: justify;">
    	The language also allows the definition of <em>native</em> libraries, 
		which consist of a list of procedure declarations. In this case, the 
		procedure code is written directly in assembly language and is not 
		included in the source file. Thanks to these native libraries, it is 
		possible to use procedures that use specific assembler instructions that 
		are not generated by the compiler, such as system calls.</p>

    <blockquote>
	<p style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10; text-align: justify;">
   	To program an application in URIUM, you must define a library called <strong>
	Main</strong> that must contain a public procedure called<em> main()</em>, 
	which represents the entry point of execution. The application can consist 
	of many other auxiliary libraries that are incorporated using import 
	clauses.</p>

              The compiler's objective is to compile the <em>Main.ur</em> file, 
			  which must contain the <em>main()</em> procedure that starts the 
			  programmed application. The remaining imported libraries are then 
			  analyzed and compiled from this main library. By default, the 
			  working directory is the directory where the compilation command 
			  is executed, but this can be changed using the options. Imported 
			  libraries are also located in the working directory by default, 
			  but other search directories can be configured using the <strong>
			  <em>-I</em></strong> option. The code for precompiled libraries is 
			  searched for in the directories defined by the <strong><em>-L</em></strong> 
			  option. The compilation result is a file with the &quot;<em>.s</em>&quot; 
			  extension containing the assembly code that develops the 
			  programmed application. By default, the output file is named &quot;<em>Application.s</em>&quot;, 
			  but this name can be changed using the<strong><em> -o</em></strong> 
			  option. The <strong><em>-v</em></strong> option can be used to 
			  instruct the compiler to generate files with a description of the 
			  intermediate code in text format. The platform for which the code 
			  is generated (the compiler's backend) is selected with specific 
			  options. The compiler supports the following options:</p>

              The URIUM distribution includes several examples, an &quot;<em>include</em>&quot; 
			  directory with the native library definitions, several directories 
			  with precompiled code for the native libraries on different 
			  platforms, and a &quot;<em>Compilation_scripts</em>&quot; directory 
			  containing the compiler and versions of compilation, assembly, and 
			  linking scripts for the various supported platforms. To compile an 
			  example, the easiest way is to copy the compiler and compilation 
			  scripts for the desired platform into the example directory and 
			  run these scripts. On emulated platforms (MIPS32 and RISC-V), the 
			  result is an assembler file that can be loaded and executed in the 
			  corresponding simulator (Qt-Spim, RARS). On the MS-Windows 
			  platform, the generated file is assembled and linked using the <em>
			  ml64</em> assembler distributed by Microsoft. On the Linux 
			  operating system, the generated file is assembled with the <em>as</em> 
			  command and linked with the <em>ld</em> command to obtain the 
			  executable.</p>
